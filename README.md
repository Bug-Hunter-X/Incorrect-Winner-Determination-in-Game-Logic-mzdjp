This repository contains a bug report and solution for an issue related to incorrect winner determination in a game's logic. The bug is caused by an oversight in handling edge cases where the scores of the two players are equal or negative. The solution provides a corrected version of the `checkWinner` function that accurately identifies the winner, regardless of the players' scores.
